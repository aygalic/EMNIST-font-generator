# EMNIST-font-generator

### Goal:

Attempt at generating a font family from EMNIST using Gen AI

### Milestones:

This project uses Variational Autoencoder and multiple learning task in order to create
a usable representation of the EMNIST dataset.

The next steps are:

- find a better tradeoff between accuracy and latent space dimension (the smaller the better)
- Perform reliable character generation
